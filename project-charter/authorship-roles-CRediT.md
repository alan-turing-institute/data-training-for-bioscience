# Contributor Roles

CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy) is a high-level taxonomy to ensure the recognition of authors and different kinds of contributions they make to the development of a research article or outcome.
I have adopted and extended the CRediT taxonomy for the community management team to guide the inclusion of broad range of contribution types aiming to ensure fair recognition of their work as authors and contributors.

## Direct Contributor Roles for Authorship

| Research stage | Definition | Direct Contributors | CM responsibilities |
|:-----|:-----------|:-----------------------|:--------|
| Design | Template, technical recommendation | Project team (at the funding stage) | Set up a version controlled repository. Ensure all stakeholders have created ORCID and are aware of DOI (Digital Object Identifiers) |
| Conceptualisation | Ideas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and aims | PI, lead/core research team | Begin developing project charter with the vision defined at the conceptualisation stage |
| Methodology | Development or design of methodology; creation of models | lead/core research team as well as Community Manager (CM) and Research Software Engineers (RSE) if in team | Enable collaborative spaces such as coworking, team meetings, in-person scoping event, shared documentation and contribution guideline |
| Software | Programming, software development; designing computer programs; implementation of the computer code and supporting algorithms; testing of existing code components | lead/core research team, RSE | Ensure that open licensing has been recommended and included in the repository, provide a collaborative process for reference collection |
| Validation | Verification, whether as a part of the activity or separate, of the overall replication/ reproducibility of results/experiments and other research outputs - generalisable | lead/core research team, Research Engineers, CM, external reviewers (expert consultation such as from community)  | Enable discussion on reproducibility, a support research team in collecting tools/methods to ensure reproducibility, involve Research Application Managers (RAM) |
| Investigation | Conducting a research and investigation process, specifically performing the experiments, or data/evidence collection | PI, lead/core research team | Create spaces for sharing progress, create a roadmap to share on the repository, provide community-wide reports or newsletters |
| Resources | Provision of study materials, reagents, materials, patients, laboratory samples, animals, instrumentation, computing resources, or other analysis tools | PI, lead/core research team, RSE, CM, RAM, IT, external partners | Coordinate with the project management team and contribute to a transparent record. Support partnership and sharing of resources. Ensure accessibility.  |
| Data Curation | Management activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub data and maintain research data (including software code, where it is necessary for interpreting the data itself) for initial use and later reuse (including licensing) | lead/core research team, partnering projects, data wranglers (if in place), RSE | Ensure GDPR/legal and ethical use of data, ensure open licensing or licensing agreement is in place. Provide access to TRE in collaboration with RSE. Ensure data protection guidelines are implemented and FAIR principles are applied. Share metadata on the repo. |
| Writing - Original Draft | Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically writing the initial draft (including substantive translation) | lead/core research team, RSE, CM, RAM, and data stewards | Ensure a clear understanding of who will be authors. Ensure contributors are not left out. Apply an inclusive approach to authorship. Ensure open access avenue for the article. Establish agreement to submit preprint. |
| Writing - Review & Editing | Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work by those from the research group, specifically critical review, commentary or revision – including pre-or postpublication stages | All members (including invited reviewers) + comms team | Ensure that the choice of the co-authoring article is collaborative (shared online document). Give access to all contributors and reviewers. All contributors to research not involved in the writing stage should be invited at this stage. Keep a record of who the authors are and their contribution types. |
| Visualisation  | Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically visualisation/ data presentation | lead/core research team, REG, and external contractors for hand sketched or digital graphics | Ensure code for data visualisation is shared with data. Support the use of literate programming with a description of data visualisation. Ensure centralisation and independent release of illustrations on Zenodo for reuse. |
| Supervision | Oversight and leadership responsibility for the research activity planning and execution, including mentorship external to the core team | lead/core research team, REG | Ensure that the decision-making process and governance process are defined and communicated transparently. |

## Contributorship

| Term | Definition | Contributors | CM responsibilities |
|:-----|:-----------|:-----------------------|:--------|
| Project administration | Management and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution | Programme Manager and Research Project Manager (PM Team) | Ensure alignment with community management tasks and goals. Ensure the findability of resources. |
| Funding acquisition | Acquisition of the financial support for the project leading to the research and publications | PI, lead/core research team, PM Team, CM | Ensure resourcing for community management and open science infrastructure. Embed open science/research considerations in the funding proposal. |
| Community Engagement  Connecting with members, enabling collaboration, identifying resources etc | CM, PM Team, RAMs | This includes the core responsibilities of the community management |
| Transparent Communication | Making all communication transparent for the stakeholders | CMs, PM Team, RAMs  - supporting everyone | Establish and maintain processes and platforms for open communication (even when the project is not open) |
| Equity, Diversity, Inclusion (EDI) and Accessibility | Accessibility of resources, consideration of disability | PI, CMs, PM Team, EDI team/committee - supporting everyone | Embed considerations for EDI and accessibility in all community engagement and research process, platform, contents |
| Cross-exchange | Worshops, skill building | PI, CM, RAM - supporting everyone | Identify skill gaps and organise skill building and/or knowledge share opportunities. Offer basic technical training regularly, Hold coworking events to allow open discussion, code review, troubleshooting etc. |
| Ethics review | Ensure that if the research project needs to undergo an ethics review process | RPM, Ethics committee - supporting PI, researchers, CM, RAM | Contribute to the application process |
| Public engagement | Communications beyond the project and the Turing | CM, community members, communications team, RAMs | Attend and support the project's participation in external and international opportunities. Identify external stakeholders and help establish collaborations. Contribute to designing and delivering high-impact events for the dissemination of project outputs |
| Engagement with funders and policymakers | Pre-publication review, External advisory board meetings, regular reporting, post-publication reporting, reaching out to the relevant policymakers actively | PI and lead/core research team - supporting everyone | Contribute to communications and collaboration process |
| Recognition and credit | Assessing incentives, creating a fair value system, fair recognition of all contributors | PI, CM, Communication team | Ensure recognition and visible record keeping for acknowledging all contributors as guided by the reference articles and resources. Ensure a shared understanding for fair recognition and incentives. |

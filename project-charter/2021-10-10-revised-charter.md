## Title: 

Introduction to Data Science for Biomedical Scientists: The Turing/Crick Partnership Project

## Aims and Objectives  

Introduction to Data Science for Biomedical Scientists is a training project developed under [the Turing-Crick strategic partnership](https://www.turing.ac.uk/collaborate-turing/current-partnerships-and-collaborations/francis-crick-institute).
We aim to provide two masterclasses for the experimental biologists and biomedical research communities, with a focus on two key professional/career groups
1. Group leaders without prior experience with Data Science and ML/AI - interested in understanding the potential additionality and application in their areas of expertise
2. Post doc/Lab scientists – next generation senior leaders - interested in additionality, but also the group more likely to benefit from tools to equip them with the requirements to enable the integration of computational science into biosciences

The Turing and Crick researchers and interested contributors from the wider open science and bioinformatics communities will be invited to share feedback which will be integrated in the design and development of training resources in this project. 
Content for the masterclassed will be complemented carefully with biological datasets to ensure that materials are relatable for our target audience and presented in an accessible manner.

We will curate materials from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) and other relevant open source projects.
Materials will be developed and hosted in The Carpentries Incubator and maintained by *The Turing Way* team members.

## Background and Motivation

Initial projects and feedback from Crick partners including [The Crick-Turing Biomedical Data Science Awards](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/crick-turing-biomedical-data-science-awards) have indicated that there is a strong need to provide introductory resources for data science in bioscience researchers.
Similar feedback has been received via the [Turing ‘omics interest group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/omics-data-generation-and-analysis-group) indicating that there is a need for foundational training for the wider cell and molecular biology community. 

Several resources exist for the early career researchers to learn about and apply data science approaches in their work.
However, there is a need to engage and educate senior researchers in biomedical research on the concepts, importance and application of data science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to allow them to make informed decisions around their application in their research.
To address the gap in training opportunities, this project will help equip experimental biomedical scientists in mid- to late- career stages with the computational skills to enable meaningful analyses of research datasets through data exploration, management, and visualisation.
Our aim will be to present unfamiliar or complex material to biologists in a relatable and easily accessible way. 

This project will directly address two main focus areas of AI for Science and Government research programmes: good data science practice; and effective communication to stakeholders. 
In building this project, we will integrate the 'Tools, practices and systems' (TPS) programme’s core values: build trustworthy systems; embed transparent reporting practices; promote inclusive interoperable design; maintain ethical integrity and encourage respectful co-creation.

## Main Considerations

Several computational resources already exist (see issues [#1](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/issues/1) and [#7](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/issues/7)), but targeted measures and opportunities are required for researchers as supervisor and advisor positions to help build a better understanding of data science and good practices for reproducible research.

In this project, two masterclasses will provide an overview on the potential additionality of AI/ML to life science disciplines, and to build a shared understanding of good practice principles to facilitate the integration and reproducibility of computational data science, into these areas.
Masterclasses
- Introduction to data science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI
- Managing and supervising computational Projects
    
Data science introductory materials will be developed and shared for anyone to repurpose and promote good practice for computational reproducibility in biomedical research.
One of the focuses of this project is to teach the importance of statistical approaches in biological research. 
For example, understanding how computational skills and programming can help apply statistical approaches to data analysis and draw insights from their research.

Our target audience will include early career researchers such as undergraduate and graduate students, and experimental biologists without prior experience in computational data analysis. 
The materials will be designed considering the needs and workflows of bench-scientists who want to analyse their experimental data programmatically or carry other downstream analyses. 
We will keep both self-paced learning experiences and trainer-directed workshop formats in mind. 
There will be potential to expand this project in the future with materials and resources for intermediate and advanced learners.

Example datasets and case studies provided by different stakeholders or curated from the public database will ensure that learners can see the biological relevance of different analysis methods.

By collaboratively and openly developing this project with domain experts, we will demonstrate and establish a culture of collaborative data science practice within experimental communities.

## Potential risks and challenges

- Lack of engagement from the stakeholders from the Crick and the Turing can lead to projects evolving in a direction that they may not have envisioned
- Failing to make connections and collaboration (as described in the previous section) with the target audience and training team at the Crick who are our primary users of this project
- Not acquiring datasets from the Crick will lead us to use public datasets or datasets from other research institutes (from open science training organisations), which may influence the original training materials to not directly address the data skills required among the Crick researchers
- The project duration and paid staff time in the project are limited to 6 months (one position at 0.5 FTE to develop the project and one position 0.2 FTE to coordinate the project by engaging with all the stakeholders). If not adhered to the strict timeline, the project team may not be able to accomplish all the milestones.
- Lack of engagement of volunteer researchers from the Crick, Turing and the wider open science training community may put the burden of development of this project on a small group of people, who will not be able to deliver everything as planned due to limited time and resources.
    
## Communication and Sustainability

- A GitHub repository under the CC-BY 4.0 and MIT license has been set to manage this project. Following the Open Source practices, the development of all materials will be coordinated via this repository.
- Emails, shared documents and surveys will be used for regular communication with the key stakeholders in the project.
- The Turing Way Slack workspace will be used for asynchronous chats and interactions among all contributors of this project.
- Zoom will be used for hosting meetings and the final sprint event.
- The Carpentries training template and incubator programme will be used for engaging with the open science training community, opening RFCs and ensuring long term sustainability of the training materials.
- Cross-disciplinary practices developed and documented in the project will be stored in The Turing Way as chapters under appropriate guides.
- Although the training course will be tailored to the biomedical sciences community, the overlap with other research communities will be considered to adapt training resources for other communities. We will engage with the data science for science theme in order to maximize cross-theme impact. Moreover, The Turing Way and REG members will maintain and share materials with domain-independent research practices that are transferable across themes.

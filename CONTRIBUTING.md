# How to contribute?

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. üéâ

Introduction to Data Science for Biomedical Scientists project is developed under the Turing-Crick Partnership to help biomedical scientists in building and enhancing their understanding of data science.

This project is being developed openly and invites contributions from anyone with prior experience in biology or data science who would like to get involved.
You can suggest topics to include in this curriculum, report mistakes/bugs, create Pull Requests to fix an error, offer resources or help develop or review the training materials.

We have a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that applies to all the activities related to this project.

Whatever is your availability, there is a way to contribute to this GitHub repository.

You can read our [proposal](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/blob/main/proposal/2021-06-ASG-proposal.md) and [README](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/blob/main/README.md) file to find details and next milestones in the project.
You can also read different issues in this repository and comment where you would like to be involved.

üéâ It's my life's mission to make data science accessible for the biological community

Please share feedback on the topics proposed to include in the curriculum, datasets or contextual application of data science in biosciences.
You are encouraged to review the material as we collaboratively develop them and get involved where you can.
Please open a GitHub issue to suggest a new topic, contribute code, or let us know about errors/bugs.

üõ† I am ready to contribute

- For open tasks in this repository, please see the [Issues section](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/issues).
- Raise mistakes, errors or missing information on this repository by opening a [Pull Request](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/pulls)
  - Read details on [how to open a Pull Request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request)
  - Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error)
  - Start work on a contribution that is already listed as an issue or something you‚Äôve already discussed
  - A Pull Request doesn‚Äôt have to represent finished work. It‚Äôs usually better to open a Pull Request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a ‚ÄúWIP‚Äù (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.

# Introduction to Data Science for Biomedical Scientists: Turing-Crick Partnership Project

## About

This project will facilitate the development of training resources on data science practices for senior researchers, group leaders, late PhD/Postdocs and mid- to late-career biomedical scientists. 
Materials developed through this project will enable a foundational understanding of AI and data science in the context of biosciences.
Furthermore, researchers will receive training for managing, supervising and facilitating open and reproducible research for the wider biology community.

### Logistics before starting the project

- [x] Draft a proposal collaboratively to define the scope of this project
- [x] Set up the repository to develop this project openly
- [x] Define scope and stakeholders for the project (help develop a project charter)
- [x] Identify potential contributors of this project at the Turing
- [x] Identify potential contributors of this project at the Crick
- [x] Define the common vision, mission and target audience
- [x] Host meetings with all stakeholders to discuss
  - The initial plans, project charter and goals
  - Agree on the best way to colleborate and communicate
  - Monthly update and feedback on the development (align expectations)
- [ ] Identify potential contributors from the wider research community
  - Other institutes, projects and people with vested interest

### Development Tasks

- [x] Define curriculum by selecting topics for content development (build concept map)
- [x] Select open source references for reuse (see issues for reference materials)
- [x] Design training curriculum (concept map, data, reusable materials) using [Carpentries Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org/)
- [x] Set up the Carpentries template for material development (see [community lessons](https://carpentries.org/community-lessons/))
- [x] Define episodes (modules) and adapt training materials for biological datasets <-- REG member
- [ ] Select biological datasets - potentially provided by the Crick <-- Focus groups
- [ ] Seek feedback periodically from all stakeholders and invite contributions <-- The Turing Way community manager
- [ ] Release the first draft and invite the community for testing the materials

*Please create [an issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/issues) to add any milestone or goals that are currently missing from the roadmap.*

# Introduction to Data Science for Biomedical Scientists: Turing-Crick Partnership Project

## About

This project will facilitate the development of introductory training resources on good data science practices for early-career biomedical scientists. 
Materials developed through this project will enable foundational training in reproducible research and data science for the wider cell and molecular biology community.

Please see the [project proposal](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/blob/main/proposal/2021-06-ASG-proposal.md) for details.

🎯 Roadmap
---

### Logistics

- [x] Draft a proposal collaboratively to define the scope of this project
- [x] Set up the repository to develop this project openly
- [x] Identify potential contributors of this project at the Turing
- [ ] Identify potential contributors of this project at the Crick
- [ ] Define the common vision, mission and target audience
- [ ] Define scope and stakeholders for the project (help develop a project charter)
- [ ] Host meeting with all stakeholders to discuss
  - The initial plans, project charter and goals
  - Agree on the best way to colleborate and communicate
  - Monthly update and feedback on the development (align expectations)

### Development

- [ ] Define curriculum by selecting topics for content development (build concept map)
- [ ] Select biological datasets - potentially provided by the Crick
- [ ] Select open source references for reuse (see issues for reference materials)
- [ ] Design training curriculum (concept map, data, reusable materials) using [Carpentries Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org/)
- [ ] Set up the Carpentries template for material development (see [community lessons](https://carpentries.org/community-lessons/))
- [ ] Define episodes (modules) and adapt training materials for biological datasets <-- REG member
- [ ] Seek feedback periodically from all stakeholders and invite contributions <-- The Turing Way community manager
- [ ] Release the first draft and invite the community for testing the materials

*Please create [an issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/issues) to add any milestone or goals that are currently missing from the roadmap.*

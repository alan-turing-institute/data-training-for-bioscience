# Turing-Crick Partnership Project

*This project will facilitate the development of strategic partnership and resources around skills and capacity building in data science in biomedical research.*

## Phase 2: Masterclasses in Data Science and AI for senior researcher

Introduction to Data Science abd AI for senior researchers, group leaders, late PhD/Postdocs and mid- to late-career biomedical scientists. 
Materials developed through this project will enable a foundational understanding of AI and data science in the context of biosciences.
Furthermore, researchers will receive training for managing, supervising and facilitating open and reproducible research for the wider biology community.
Funded by the AI for Science and Government Research programme, this project ran from October 2021 to March 2022.

This project is a follow up of [The Crick-Turing Biomedical Data Science Awards (BDSAs)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/crick-turing-biomedical-data-science-awards) (**Phase 1** project period: 01/10/2019 – 28/02/2021) carried out under the Turing and Crick partnership.

### Masterclasses developed in this prgramme

- Introduction to Data Science and AI for senior researchers: https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/data-science-ai-senior-researchers/
- Managing Open and Reproducible Computational Projects: https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/managing-computational-projects/

Researchers from outside this project were invited to review and enhance these materials by integrating real-world examples from their work.
Additionally, professional illustrators (Scriberia) worked with researchers in this projects to develop illustrations to be paired with the written contents.

All materials including the illustrations (see [`illustrations-from-review-sprint`](./illustrations-from-review-sprint)) are shared under CC-BY 4.0 License for reuse, remix, sharing and distribution with appropriate citation.

## Main deliverables

Training materials for two masterclasses will be developed and shared from this project.

1. Introduction to data science and AI for senior researchers: This masterclass will also touch on some concepts related to algorithm selection, statistical approaches and the potential additionality of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
2. Managing and supervising computational Projects: This masterclass will provide an understanding of open source tools, version control, literate programming, Markdown, GitHub, metadata and other collaborative approaches.
    
Inviting feedback from the mid- to late-career researchers from the Turing, the Crick and wider research communities, these masterclasses will build a shared understanding of good practice principles to facilitate the integration of reproducible computational approaches from data science into biological research.

## The Carpentries Incubator

The training materials will be developed openly from the start under [The Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries.org/community-lessons/#the-carpentries-incubator) GitHub organisation.

These are two separate GitHub repositories for the two masterclasses:
- Masterclass 1: Introduction to Data Science and AI for senior researchers: https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/data-science-ai-senior-researchers
- Masterclass 2: Managing Open and Reproducible Computational Projects: https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/managing-computational-projects

Though developed under subtitles Masterclass 1 and 2, both the materials will be standalone and modular to encourage their use independent of each other.

*Please create [an issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/issues) to add any milestone or goals that are currently missing from the roadmap, or to suggest new features.*

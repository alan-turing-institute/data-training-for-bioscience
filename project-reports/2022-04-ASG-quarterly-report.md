## About the project

Introduction to Data Science for Biomedical Scientists is a Turing-Crick Partnership Project that will facilitate the development of training resources on data science practices for senior researchers, group leaders, late PhD/Postdocs and mid- to late-career biomedical scientists. Materials developed through this project will enable a foundational understanding of AI and data science in the context of biosciences. Furthermore, researchers will receive training for managing, supervising and facilitating open and reproducible research for the wider biology community.

**Notable/substantive activity/outcomes in research progress**

- The project charter was revised and shared online with updated goals, timeline and roadmap ([see on GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/blob/main/project-charter/2021-10-10-revised-charter.md)).
- The Crick Partnership Officer, Rebecca Wilson, helped the development team invite 18 senior researchers to contribute to the co-development of the training materials via feedback or 1:1 interview. Five of these researchers volunteered to be interviewed by the development team where they shared examples from their work that either uses computational approaches or can be enhanced massively through good practices for a data science project management. A summary from this interview has been shared here:[#23](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/issues/23)).
- The project development team also collaborated with Sebastian Ahnert, a senior research fellow at Turing, who invited two post-doctoral research associates from the Norwich Biosciences Institutes to contribute to the project through their research exploring the application of ML to biological research in new and interesting ways.
- Simultaneously, a public request for comment (RFC) was announced on various social media and online collaboration platforms of The Turing Way, an open science community-driven project that is co-led by Malvika Sharan. This invited expressions of interest from senior postdocs and mid-career researchers from international organisations and communities. Specifically, open science practitioners from The Turing Way, Open Life Science and The Carpentries expressed their interest to participate in the project in the coming months.
- The project team designed a set of questionnaires to facilitate feedback from researchers from Crick and Turing with relevant experience in biosciences and data science respectively. In February, five senior researchers from the Crick were interviewed in February 2022 to include their perspectives in the co-production of the training materials. Two Turing fellows also participated in the feedback session. This ongoing partnership allowed the development team to broadly enhance the quality of the training materials by highlighting relevant examples from biomedical fields (expertise at the Crick) and Artificial Intelligence (expertise at the Turing). For example, case studies and insights shared in these feedback sessions are being integrated into the training materials.
- There are three project outputs that are being developed through this partnership: (1) Project repository on GitHub:[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/). This repository provides the project management documents and allows all stakeholders of this project to track progress openly. (2) Training materials for &quot;Managing Open and Reproducible Computational Projects&quot; are being developed and managed via the online repository for developers:[https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/managing-computational-projects](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/managing-computational-projects). A web page for learners is being developed:[https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/managing-computational-projects/](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/managing-computational-projects/). This training material covers best practices for managing and supervising computational projects in biology and related fields through data science methods, analysis, interpretation, and reporting processes. Through applications of scientific rigour and ethical approaches, researchers will be able to combine lessons learned in this training to design reproducible, transparent and collaborative computational projects. (3) Training materials for &quot;Introduction to Data Science and AI for senior researchers&quot; are being developed and managed via the online repository for developers:[https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/data-science-ai-senior-researchers](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/data-science-ai-senior-researchers). A web page will be developed in the upcoming months. Materials developed through this project will enable a foundational understanding of AI and data science in the context of biosciences.
- The completed lessons in each material still require reviews from external experts and several unfinished lessons need to be completed. To enable that, the project team has designed a review sprint (reusing The Turing Way Book Dash event) on 28 and 29 April that will invite researchers and experts interested in reusing these materials to review and enhance the quality of its content. An artist from Scriberia has also been invited to this event to engage participants in developing illustrations that can be integrated into the training materials to communicate complex concepts easily. All materials generated from this event will be linked to the GitHub repository and illustrations will be published on Zenodo under CC-BY 4.0 License ([https://zenodo.org/record/5706310](https://zenodo.org/record/5706310)).

**Status of progress against goals/milestones, any blockers to progress**

- The development of the training materials started with a slight delay as reported in the previous report. The project member allocated in the project could not manage to carry out all responsibilities due to limited time in the project. A handover meeting was conducted for the data scientists from REG to create debrief notes ([see on GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/blob/main/meeting-notes/2022-04-08-hand-over-meeting.md)) from the project and hand over the project in the current status. To complete the unfinished lesson in the project, volunteer support from researchers outside the project in a review and illustration sprint in April.

**Webpage updates** (if applicable)

- Webpage on the Turing website has been requested, which will be linked to the main partnership page.

**Conference/workshop talks presented** (please name the event, dates â€“ include link/s)

- A Turing podcast is scheduled in June.

**Articles/blogs/press releases published** (include link/s)

**Software/code/tools/methods developed/released** (include link/s)

- As initially proposed and agreed upon by all stakeholders, the training resources have been developed openly under The Carpentries incubator under the CC-BY 4.0 License.

**External engagement, influence, impact (Academic/ industry/ government/ public/ international)**

- The training materials in this project have been developed using The Carpentries template and infrastructure of lesson hosting. The Carpentries builds global capacity in essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research. The Carpentries contributors include a team of 10 staff members and 1000s of volunteer instructors and trainers who have trained over 15000 international researchers worldwide. A huge proportion of this community is working in the bioscience field who have the familiarity of how to work with The Carpentries lesson template. Since several of them will be potential users and trainers of the training materials developed under this project, the immediate impact of using The Carpentries infrastructure have ensured technical support and direct contributions in the development of our training materials. Furthermore, as an open source project, it has already allowed our materials to be reviewed openly through an iterative feedback process in open collaboration.

## Collaborations & Partnerships

**Provide a short name/title for this collaboration or partnership.**

- The Turing-Crick Strategic Partnership
- Collaborator: Francis Crick Institute

**Briefly describe the contributions made by you and/or your research team to this collaboration or partnership.**

Introduction to Data Science for Biomedical Scientists is a Turing-Crick Partnership Project that aims to facilitate the development of training resources on data science practices for senior researchers, group leaders, late PhD/Postdocs and mid to late-career biomedical scientists. Materials developed through this project will enable a foundational understanding of AI and data science in the context of biosciences. Furthermore, researchers will receive educational resources for managing, supervising and facilitating open and reproducible research for the wider biology community.

Project scoping meetings were attended by the key stakeholders from The Alan Turing Institute that include, Ben McArthur, Malvika Sharan, Kirstie Whitaker and Roly Perera, from the ASG/Health programme, Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS) and Research Engineering Group (REG). The initially proposed project design and charter were shared online on GitHub under an open license: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/.

The training resources in this project are being developed openly under The Carpentries incubator programme and will be shared via the Turing online training platform. Lydia France, Junior Research Data Scientist (0.5 FTE) was onboarded as a paid staff on the project to co-develop training materials planned in this project. She is supported and supervised by the TPS Senior Researcher Malvika Sharan and REG Senior Data Scientist, Federico Nanni, henceforth referred to as the development team. The development team meets weekly to check in and review the development and progress of the project. The Health theme lead, Alisha Davies and the TPS programme director Kirstie Whitaker receive updates from the project and provide necessary feedback to the development team regularly.

**Briefly describe the contributions made by your partners to this collaboration or partnership.**

The project kick-off meeting in October 2021 took place online with the stakeholders involving ten senior researchers and research support staff from the Crick Institute. This meeting enabled discussions around mission, goals and project timeline as described in the project charter. Through active dialogue between the Turing and the Crick members, the project was revised to engage senior researchers at the Crick rather than early career researchers as initially planned. Based on the joint recommendations from senior researchers at the Crick and the Turing Institute, the goals and deliverables for the project were revised to accommodate the learning requirements from our partner organisation.

A follow-up meeting with the Crick Members was held in December 2021, where the Turing development team presented the revised goals, project outline and draft of the training materials. This meeting particularly invited contributions from the Crick members. A final set of goals, deliverables as well as the timeline (dates) were agreed upon that includes the development of materials for two masterclasses (1) introduction to data science and AI for the biomedical researchers, and (2) managing open and reproducible computational projects in biosciences.

Through this partnership, five senior researchers from the Crick and two Turing Fellows (outside the project) were interviewed in February 2022 to include their perspectives in the co-production of the training materials. This ongoing partnership will allow the development team to broadly enhance the quality of the training materials by integrating relevant examples from biomedical fields (expertise at the Crick) and Artificial Intelligence (expertise at the Turing).

**List any outputs or outcomes that have resulted from this collaboration or partnership. Full details of each should be reported under the relevant sections of the form. Indicate whether this collaboration is multi-disciplinary, if so outline each of the disciplines involved.**

There are three project outputs that are being developed through this partnership:
1) Project repository on GitHub: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/. This repository provides the project management documents and allows all stakeholders of this project to track progress openly.
2) Training materials for “Managing Open and Reproducible Computational Projects” are being developed and managed via the online repository for developers: https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/managing-computational-projects. A web page for learners is being developed: https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/managing-computational-projects/. This training material covers best practices for managing and supervising computational projects in biology and related fields through data science methods, analysis, interpretation, and reporting processes. Through applications of scientific rigour and ethical approaches, researchers will be able to combine lessons learned in this training to design reproducible, transparent and collaborative computational projects. 
3) Training materials for “Introduction to Data Science and AI for senior researchers” are being developed and managed via the online repository for developers: https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/data-science-ai-senior-researchers. A web page will be developed in the upcoming months. Materials developed through this project will enable a foundational understanding of AI and data science in the context of biosciences.

## Engagement activities

User interviews and open science community collaboration

**What was the engagement activity? We are interested in any activity intended to communicate your research beyond your normal peer group and which involved you or a member of your team, regardless of whether this was presenting to or otherwise engaging directly with an audience**

Event, workshop, Similar

**Please estimate how many people this activity reached**

10-50

**What was the geographical 'reach' of this activity (e.g. was the audience from your local institution, drawn from attendees across the region, nation, or international)?**

International

**Who was the primary audience engaged with?**

Professional Practitioners

**In which year did this activity take place?**

2021-2022

**Briefly describe the activity, please include the intended purpose and any outcomes or impacts that have arisen from it if known. For example, "60 pupils attended for a school visit to the research organisation, which sparked questions and discussion afterwards, and the school reported increased interest in related subject areas."** 

The project contributors from the Crick helped the development team invite 18 senior researchers to contribute to the co-development of the training materials via feedback or 1:1 interview. Five of these researchers volunteered to be interviewed by the development team where they shared examples from their work that either uses computational approaches or can be enhanced massively through good practices for data science project management. A summary from this interview have been shared here: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/issues/23). 

The project development team also collaborated with Sebastian Ahnert, a senior research fellow at Turing, who invited two post doctoral research associates from the  Norwich Biosciences Institutes to contribute to the project through their research exploring application of ML to biological research in new and interesting ways.

Simultaneously, a public request for comment (RfC) was announced on various social media and online collaboration platforms of The Turing Way, an open science community driven project that is co-led by Malvika Sharan. This invited expressions of interest from senior postdocs and mid-career researchers from international organisations and communities. Specifically, open science practitioners from The Turing Way, Open Life Science and The Carpentries expressed their interest to participate in the project in coming months.

**Briefly describe the software or technical product.**

As initially proposed and agreed upon by all stakeholders, the training resources will be developed openly under The Carpentries incubator programme and shared via the Turing online training platform.
The Carpentries hosts all of the lessons on GitHub using a pedagogically designed template that provides aesthetic and structural consistency across all lessons. Template files for each lesson are rendered into a webpage using Jekyll - a static site generator which is written in Ruby.

The development team have worked on the prototype first module of this project, “Managing Open and Reproducible Computational Projects” available online: https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/managing-computational-projects/. Each lesson is made up of episodes, which are focused on a particular topic, learning objectives, key message/take-away and include time for both teaching and exercises. A lesson repository (or “repo”) includes one file for each episode, and a set of helper files that are required to build the lesson webpage. Details can be read on The Carpentries Lesson Development Handbook: https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development/technological-introductions.html. 

**Please select the year that this output was realised.**

2022

**Briefly describe any notable impacts resulting from the development of this software or technical product.**

The Carpentries builds global capacity in essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research. The Carpentries contributors include a team of 10 staff members and 1000s of volunteer instructors and trainers who have trained over 15000 international researchers worldwide. A huge proportion of this community is working in the bioscience field who have the familiarity of how to work with The Carpentries lesson template. Since several of them will be potential users and trainers of the training materials developed under this project, the immediate impact of using The Carpentries infrastructure have ensured technical support and direct contributions in the development of our training materials. Furthermore, as an open source project, it has already allowed our materials to be reviewed openly through an iterative feedback process in open collaboration.

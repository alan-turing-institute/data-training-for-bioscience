Review and pilot delivery of the training for project leaders - funded by The Turing Health programme

- _The Turing Way_ team: Malvika Sharan (Senior Researcher), Alexandra Araujo Alvarez (Research Project Manager)
- Health Programme: Maya Bronfeld (Programme Manager)
- Collaborators:
  - Julien Colomb, TU Berlin
  - Jo Havemann, Access 2 Perspectives

**Briefly describe the contributions made by you and/or your research team to this collaboration or partnership.**

The Health program allocated £5000 to support the review and delivery of training materials that were previously developed under the Turing-Crick partnership and funded by ASG. Two sets of training materials were collaboratively developed in 2022 on GitHub repositories openly. 

With the recent funding from Health, the project team collaborated with Julien Colomb from TU Berlin, receiving valuable in-kind support, and Jo Havemann from Access 2 Perspective. Access 2 Perspective was contracted to conduct an external review and editing of the materials and lead the delivery of a pilot training workshop. Throughout this process, _The Turing Way_ community was actively engaged, fostering a community-driven approach to the project.

**Briefly describe the contributions made by your partners to this collaboration or partnership.**

This collaboration resulted in the revision and enhancement of the training material titled "Introduction to Data Science and AI for Senior Researchers" (available at: https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/data-science-ai-senior-researchers/). Additionally, the second set of training materials, "Managing Open and Reproducible Computational Projects" (https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/managing-computational-projects/), underwent a comprehensive restructuring. Supporting resources for trainers were also developed, enhancing the delivery of the training workshop.

On September 14th and 15th, the training was piloted by Jo, Julien, and Malvika with the participation of senior postdocs and support infrastructure staff from various international organisations. The event attracted 25 registrations, with 10 individuals being invited to the workshop. These participants were selected to engage, provide feedback, and leverage the resources to conduct future workshops within their organisations. Details of the event can be found on [Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/managing-open-reproducible-computational-projects-for-project-leaders-tickets-691159656137?aff=oddtdtcreator). The materials used for the workshop, along with participant feedback, will be instrumental in supporting other trainers interested in facilitating these sessions within their networks.

**List any outputs or outcomes that have resulted from this collaboration or partnership. Full details of each should be reported under the relevant sections of the form. Indicate whether this collaboration is multi-disciplinary, if so outline each of the disciplines involved.**

The partnership has resulted in the development of several project outputs, showcasing a commitment to transparency, accessibility, and collaboration:

1) **Project Repository on GitHub:** The project's primary repository, available at [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/), serves as a central hub for project management documents. It enables all stakeholders to openly track the project's progress.

2) **“Introduction to Data Science and AI for Senior Researchers” Web Page:** The web page for this training module is now published and accessible at [https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/data-science-ai-senior-researchers/](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/data-science-ai-senior-researchers/).

3) **“Managing Open and Reproducible Computational Projects” Web Page for Learners:** The web page for this training module  at now published and accessible at [https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/managing-computational-projects/](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/managing-computational-projects/).

4) **Materials Developed for the Training Workshop:** All materials developed for the training workshop, including presentations, documents, and supplementary resources, are stored in a shared Google Drive folder: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tZt2rhcOR0Msc0rYfIOprV7R0oMCLj1J?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tZt2rhcOR0Msc0rYfIOprV7R0oMCLj1J?usp=sharing).

## Engagement activities

A two-day online training session was successfully conducted on September 14-15. The training was tailored for a diverse audience, including 10 post-doctoral researchers and mid-career to senior researchers.

**What was the engagement activity? We are interested in any activity intended to communicate your research beyond your normal peer group and which involved you or a member of your team, regardless of whether this was presenting to or otherwise engaging directly with an audience**

Event, workshop, Similar

**Please estimate how many people this activity reached**

**What was the geographical 'reach' of this activity (e.g. was the audience from your local institution, drawn from attendees across the region, nation, or international)?**

**In which year did this activity take place?**

2023

**Briefly describe the activity, please include the intended purpose and any outcomes or impacts that have arisen from it if known. For example, "60 pupils attended for a school visit to the research organisation, which sparked questions and discussion afterwards, and the school reported increased interest in related subject areas."** 

Two sets of training materials underwent a comprehensive review process conducted by the team and external collaborators. This process focused on verifying the accuracy of the information, enhancing the logical progression of topics through the reorganisation of previously developed lessons, and enriching the materials by addressing any gaps or missing content.

To support these efforts, an external consultant was hired to review and create supplementary materials and spearhead the facilitation of a training workshop. This workshop served as a practical test for the project team and involved trainers in evaluating the considerations necessary to effectively utilise these materials.

The workshop provided an opportunity to engage the intended target audience. This interaction enabled the team to collect feedback, which will be instrumental in refining and enhancing the quality and delivery of future workshops.

Open Source

**What Open Source licence is the software or technical product licensed under?**

MIT

**Briefly describe the software or technical product.**

The training resources were developed openly under the Turing GitHub infrastructure and The Carpentries incubator programme.
The Carpentries hosts all of the lessons on GitHub using a pedagogically designed template that provides aesthetic and structural consistency across all lessons.
The two sets of training materials together include 14 episodes, each focused on a particular topic, learning objectives, and key messages for the learners.
These resources are openly available for reuse by other trainers.

**Please select the year that this output was realised.**

2023

**Briefly describe any notable impacts resulting from the development of this software or technical product.**

The revision of previously developed training materials has significantly enhanced the quality of these resources, making them more suitable for future use by researchers. The materials were tested in an online workshop that attracted a diverse group of participants from the UK, New Zealand, Cameroon, Germany, Australia, Nigeria, and the US. This event sparked considerable interest among researchers who expressed a desire to provide further feedback and facilitate the workshop themselves.

In the future, the workshop will be offered as part of _The Turing Way_ collaboration within the "Data Science without Borders" project. This initiative is led by the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC) in Kenya and the Africa CDC, with a team of researchers including Malvika Sharan from The Turing Institute collaborating.

## About the project

Introduction to Data Science for Biomedical Scientists is a Turing-Crick Partnership Project that will facilitate the development of training resources on data science practices for senior researchers, group leaders, late PhD/Postdocs and mid- to late-career biomedical scientists. Materials developed through this project will enable a foundational understanding of AI and data science in the context of biosciences. Furthermore, researchers will receive training for managing, supervising and facilitating open and reproducible research for the wider biology community.

## Notable/substantive activity/outcomes in research progress

-   Project scoping meeting took place followed by a proposal submission by the key stakeholders, Ben McArthur, Malvika Sharan, Kirstie Whitaker and Roly Perera, from the ASG/Health programme, Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS) and Research Engineering Group (REG). A project repository and charter was created on GitHub: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/).
-   Lydia France, Junior Research Data Scientist (0.5 FTE) was onboarded as a paid staff on the project who is supported and supervised by the TPS Senior Researcher Malvika Sharan and REG Senior Data Scientist, Federico Nanni. These three members are henceforth referred to as the development team. The development team meets weekly to check-in and review the development and progress of the project.
-   Project kick-off meeting with the stakeholders involving 20 participants from the Turing and Crick enabled discussions around mission, goals and project timeline as described in the project charter. The Crick members expressed their interest in engaging senior researchers at the Crick with this project. Based on the joint recommendations from senior researchers at the Crick and Turing, we revised the goals and deliverables for the programme (see: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/blob/main/proposal/2021-09-27-kick-off-meeting.md](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/blob/main/proposal/2021-09-27-kick-off-meeting.md)).
-   A follow-up meeting with the Crick Members was held in December where the Turing development team presented the revised goals, project outline and draft of the training materials. This meeting particularly invited contributions from the Crick members, who provided feedback from senior Crick researchers which had been collated in a separate internal meeting in Crick (see: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/blob/main/proposal/2021-12-09-project-meeting.md](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/blob/main/proposal/2021-12-09-project-meeting.md)).
-   A final set of goals, deliverables as well as the timeline (dates) were agreed upon that includes the development of materials for two masterclasses (1) introduction to data science and AI for the biomedical researchers, and (2) managing open and reproducible computational projects in biosciences. Importantly, a group of Crick researchers who will be using the training materials have been identified by Crick. These researchers will be involved in the co-production of the  final training materials and provide  relevant examples from their fields of expertise to integrate into the training materials to help illustrate application to practice (see: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/blob/main/proposal/2021-12-16-project-update.md](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/blob/main/proposal/2021-12-16-project-update.md)).

## Status of progress against goals/milestones, any blockers to progress

-   The proposal was revised iteratively as the Crick members (both researchers and management team) were not initially involved in the scoping and designing of the project charter. As one of the key stakeholders and users of the project, this back and forth communication was crucial to ensure  the project met needs and was relevant to their areas of expertise. The slower engagement  led to a delay in the original project timeline, but it was key to ensuring the project's success. A more defined partnership in the project from the start could help set expectations for active collaboration from the Crick members and potentially reduce this delay.

## Webpage updates

-   There is no webpage for this project. However, if possible, we would like to request a webpage and feature the outcomes from the project.
    

## Software/code/tools/methods developed/released (include link/s)

-   As initially proposed and agreed upon by all stakeholders, the training resources will be developed openly under The Carpentries incubator programme and shared via the Turing online training platform. The Carpentries have created these GitHub repositories for the two masterclasses: 
-   [https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/data-science-ai-senior-researchers](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/data-science-ai-senior-researchers)
-   [https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/managing-computational-projects](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/managing-computational-projects) 

## External engagement, influence, impact (Academic/ industry/ government/ public/ international)

-   The Crick members are being engaged in the project and being involved in the co-development of the projectâ€™s aim and mission. In the coming months, several senior researchers from the Crick will be invited to participate in a focus group or 1:1 interview to share their feedback and insights on the initial draft of the training materials.
-   As an open science project, many external research teams and communities are also being engaged at the various stages of the project. Some of these engagements have been invited from the Institute for Cancer Research and European Molecular Biology Laboratory. Open science projects that are involved in the dissemination of the project include [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome), [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), [Ed-Dash - Edinburgh Carpentriues](https://edcarp.github.io/Ed-DaSH/index.html) and [Repro4Everyone](https://www.repro4everyone.org/) project.

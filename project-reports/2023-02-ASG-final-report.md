# Phase 2: Masterclasses in Data Science and AI for senior researchers

***Turing-Crick partnership project***

Introduction to Data Science and AI for senior researchers, group leaders, late PhD/Postdocs and mid to late-career biomedical scientists. Materials developed through this project will enable a foundational understanding of AI and data science in the context of biosciences. Furthermore, researchers will receive training for managing, supervising and facilitating open and reproducible research for the wider biology community. Funded by the AI for Science and Government Research programme, this project ran from October 2021 to March 2022.
This project is a follow-up of The Crick-Turing Biomedical Data Science Awards (BDSAs) (Phase 1 project period: 01/10/2019 – 28/02/2021) carried out under the Turing and Crick partnership.

1. Key papers/outputs published
- Key resources published in this project are shared via GitHub: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience. 
- Two main training resources for masterclasses developed in this programme:
  - Introduction to Data Science and AI for senior researchers: https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/data-science-ai-senior-researchers/
  - Managing Open and Reproducible Computational Projects: https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/managing-computational-projects/
- All illustrations developed in this project have been shared online: https://zenodo.org/record/6560477 
 
2. Additional funding leveraged
- Additional funding has been offered to the Health programme via the Technology Mission Fund, part of which has been allocated to support the next phase of this project to enable the delivery of the workshops.
 
3. Impact or link (especially with Governmental departments) 
- The project contributors from the Crick helped the development team invite 18 senior researchers to contribute to the co-development of the training materials via feedback or 1:1 interview. Five of these researchers were interviewed by the development team where they shared examples from their work that either uses computational approaches or can be enhanced massively through good practices for data science project management.
- The project development team also collaborated with Sebastian Ahnert, a senior research fellow at Turing, who invited two post-doctoral research associates from the Norwich Biosciences Institutes to contribute to the project through their research exploring the application of ML to biological research in new and interesting ways.
Simultaneously, a two-day workshop (review and illustration sprint) was organised on 28 and 29 April 2022, that enabled collaboration with 10 post-docs and PIs from national and international organisations including King's College London (UK), Teesside University (UK), SciLife Lab (Sweden), Humboldt University Berlin (Germany), Addis Ababa University (Ethiopia), MBOA Lab (Cameroon) and University of New South Wales Sydney (Australia) collaborated to review and enhance the quality of the training content, to improve reusability of the materials. 
- A set of illustrations were co-created with a Scriberia artist to be integrated in the training materials, which are published on Zenodo under CC-BY 4.0 License (https://zenodo.org/record/6560477). 
All project reports and impact have been shared online: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/tree/main/project-reports
 
4. A sentence on what you see to have been the added value of ASG - what has it enabled which wouldn’t have otherwise been possible?
- One of the biggest gaps in the Data Science and AI project and skill landscape is the lack of shared understanding among senior professionals regarding (1) what AI can do for health research; and (2) how to ensure the integration of open research (transparency) and reproducibility practices at different stages of the research lifecycle. The training materials for the senior researchers have been developed by the Turing researchers to fill that knowledge gap, which would not have been possible through the funding and senior leadership support of the ASG research programme.
 
5. What’s next – how it will develop
- Enabled by the funding made available by the Health programme, the project has hired a contractor offering expert pedagogical expertise to the training development team by delivering the first workshop intending to improve the materials for the practical workshop. This work will take place in March and April 2023. The further iteration of the workshop and the subsequent collaboration with the Crick institute will be supported by the newly launched Practitioners Hub, led by The Turing Way team in the Tools, Practices and Systems programme from April 2023 onwards. The workshop materials developed in this project will serve as a crucial skill-building resource for all of The Turing Way Practitioners Hub’s UK partners, including the Crick Institute in its inaugural cohort.

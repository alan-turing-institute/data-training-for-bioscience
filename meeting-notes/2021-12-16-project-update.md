# Project update 16/12/2021

## Target audience: 

Experimental biologists and biomedical research communities, with a focus on two key professional/career groups

1.  Group leaders without prior experience with Data Science and ML/AI - interested in understanding the potential additionality and application in their areas of expertise
    
2.  Post doc/Lab scientists – next generation senior leaders - interested in additionality, but also the group more likely to benefit from tools to equip them with the requirements to enable the integration of computational science into biosciences
    
## Content: 

Two masterclasses will provide an overview on the potential additionality of AI/ML to life science disciplines, and to build a shared understanding of good practice principles to facilitate the integration and reproducibility of computational data science, into these areas.

### Masterclasses

-   Introduction to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI (including considerations from the PIs) ← integrating additional feedback from Crick, [aligned to user needs, see [1]
-   Managing and supervising  computational Projects (open source tools, version control, literate programming, Markdown, GitHub, reproducibility, grants, peer review, metadata, collaboration, reproducibility) ← renamed this 
    

### Learning objectives

At the end of these masterclasses, attendees will:

-   understand what successful applications for open and reproducible Data Science and AI/ML approaches in life sciences looks like
-   be able to examine challenges and potential pitfalls in applying best practices Data Science and AI/ML approaches (mismatch between ML method and problem; reproducibility, software sustainability, reproducibility, grants, peer review, collaboration, open tools, how to find expertise, open science)
-   design computational projects using collaborative, reproducible and open science approaches (for example building ML image tools for cells on GitHub, developing deep learning algorithm for genomics by involving multiple groups)
-   explore what additionality data science and ML/AI can bring to their research
-   identify tools and practices required for managing computational projects
-   assess resource required for them to effectively apply data science and AI in their context
-   apply systematic framework to introduce computational protocols in their groups
    

### Next steps for learners

-   Connecting training materials with set of resources for deeper dive into various topics required to learn and apply Data Science, AI and computational research best practices
-   Establishing connections with other training and training materials offered by the Turing and the Crick
-   Linking with other projects in open research, data science and AI that offers opportunities to develop/enhance technical skills
    

[1] Comments from Rebecca, James Briscoe: 

-   Introduction to machine learning including: 
-   Intro to different algorithm types and how to choose what to use
-   Splitting datasets appropriately and avoiding leakage. 
-   Problem of imbalanced data sets and of overfitting
-   Statistics to evaluate output (precision-recall etc)
-   Pointers to where to start with different approaches
-   Specific/specialist topics: What does this look like? ← action point on this one
-   Computational project management/supervising computational projects: The underlying theme for all this is how to make computational projects transparent, reproducible etc. The goal would be a framework for a GL to feel more confident supervising a computational biologist. This course could include: 
-   Organising a project: Practical directory and file structures for comp projects
-   Metadata: Use relevant examples to the Crick (e.g. genomics and imaging)
-   Intro to Github and importance of version control
-   Intro to markdown and Jupyter notebooks

Timeline: Next stage in the project
-----------------------------------

**Turing Team**: 
-   Develop the format, questions and materials required for the 1:1 meeting with the Crick PIs (UX plan) before 15 January 2022.
-   Integrate suggestions described in this document across two masterclasses (Please note that the masterclass now listed as the second masterclass is currently being developed which will be shared on GitHub)
**Crick and Turing Teams**: 
To arrange 1:1 or focus group with the Crick PIs (potential target audience)  between 15 January 2022 - 22 February 2022 to explore challenges, concerns and understanding of best practices in data science from their fields, which can be integrated into the training courses. (James F. to coordinate from the Crick team)
- Crick Team:  Provide more details on the suggested specialist topics/areas from PI’s preferably by 20 January 2022. This will be crucial in deciding the location for these topics between the two proposed masterclasses. Please let the Turing Team know if more time might be required.
- Turing Team: To continue developing and refining two masterclasses in line with the details above, apply examples from the Turing and Crick (look for these examples in the UX process). To ensure iterative and collaborative development, as well as sustainability of two masterclasses, the materials will be shared via a GitHub repository using The Carpentries training format (under CC-BY 4.0 license):
- Both Teams: Turing Team to share the first drafts of the one masterclass for comments, suggestions and co-development on GitHub with the Crick Team by 25 March 2022.
- Project finishes and launches on 31 March 2022.

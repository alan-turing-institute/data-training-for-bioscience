- Update on the curriculum design by Lydia & Fede (draft here: Draft curriculum: Overview session, optional masterclasses and suggestions #17) [15 mins]
- Overview of the planned curriculum and content to be discussed in the 1st masterclass
- Update from Crick team on expectations/needs from this project for Group Leaders and operational teams [15 mins]
- Open discussion on motivation, learning objectives and next steps to include specifically in in AI/ML masterclass [15 mins]
- Next steps and wrap up
[Please add any agenda point here]

## Attending:
* Kirstie Whitaker (Turing)
* Lydia France (Turing)
* James Fleming (Crick)
* Amy Strange (Crick)
* Harry Meacher (Turing)
* Malvika Sharan (Turing)
* Federico Nanni (Turing) 
* Alden Conner (Turing) 
* Rebecca Wilson (Crick)
* Alisha Davies (Turing)
* Arielle Bennett (Turing)

## 1. Project Status: Overview Masterclasses

Part 1: Managing open and reproducible computational Projects: challenges and benefits (reproducibility, collaboration, open tools, version control and importance in grants, peer review, academic incentives)

Part 2: Introduction to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI (including considerations from the PIs)

### Optional masterclasses:

Open & Reproducible Pipelines:
* Part 1: From raw data to computational analysis
* Part 2: From computational analysis to publication/sharing
* Management of Computational Projects:
* Part 3: Data, code, and research objects
* Part 4: Managing teams and collaborations

#### Notes:

* AS: Pitfalls and challenges are of particular interest and target GLs
* RW: Primary concern is not reproducibility angle, but about not being aware of what we donâ€™t know
* JF.: Concerns raised by the Crick team members: that senior researchers wonâ€™t engage if too basic an overview is given at the start. Overview might be too basic for them, how can we go immediately to applications
* LF: senior researchers and established computational GLs are not the the primary target
* MS: The project needs to be developed for larger application (beyond the Turing and Crick)

## 2. Report back from the Crick team members

RW: Three set of topics that the Crick member shared as suggestions and ideas to include in the project:
- Foundational: Introduction to machine learning including: 
  - Intro to different algorithm types and how to choose what to use
  - Splitting datasets appropriately and avoiding leakage. 
  - Problem of imbalanced data sets and of overfitting
  - Statistics to evaluate output (precision-recall etc)
  - Pointers to where to start with different approaches

- Specific/specialist topics 
- Computational project management/supervising computational projects. The underlying theme for all this is how to make computational projects transparent, reproducible etc. The goal would be a framework for a GL to feel more confident supervising a computational biologist. This course could include: 
  - Organising a project: Practical directory and file structures for comp projects
  - Metadata, metadataâ€¦. Use relevant examples to the Crick (e.g. genomics and imaging)
  - Intro to Github and importance of version control
  - Intro to markdown and Jupyter notebooks
 
- The Crick team: Consider including Future directions: breakthrough technology
- Turing dev team: Thinking about the project modules as standalone, so that other organisations can reuse it 

## 3. Notes from the open discussions

- JF: Generalisability is important, but we need to understand the applications
- MS & FN: Discussion on focus group
  - GLs from Crick, Turing and some other orgs
  - Targeted 8-10 people interested in the project
  - Where do they want to try and apply this
  - Scienceâ€™s perspective (example)
- JF: Can we run that synchronously?
  - Already made a few GLs aware at the Crick and will be happy to connect them with the dev team
- AD: Running 1:1 with some busy people might be more effective
- JF: In the materials we should arrive as soon as possible to what is meaningful for the GLs
- AD: Additionality that AI brings to each modules (see summary notes from Alisha below)
- AS.: Add some context: experimental design, Proposals and grant writing
- Dev team will back and evaluate timeline, share slots for 1:1 with GLs next year

## Action points for the project members
- Development team to share the goals and objectives with everyone
- Engage with target audience - Senior Group Leaders to refine content - James Fleming and Rebecca to coordinate for the Crick scientists

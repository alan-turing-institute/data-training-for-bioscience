***Attendees / Icebreaker response (prompt: What gap in computational skills have you seen (either in the past or currently) in your research group/team?)***

-   Ben McArthur - would like to see closer interaction between experimentalists and computational researchers
-   Malvika Sharan - In the past working with experimentalists, I think they could benefit from automated workflow for tabular data exploration and visualisation.
-   Kirstie Whitaker - I’ve seen a lot of folks be really good at writing their algorithms - the fun parts of the analyses - but not great on capturing all of the data wrangling and figure making / results reporting steps. So while a step might work it’s hard to see how the whole workflow can be re-run from the start.
-   Federico Nanni - understanding common language to express computational problems/needs
-   Amy Strange - common language to communicate among researchers and reproducibility
-   James Fleming - access and ability to store data and use tools from clouds
-   James Briscoe - resources to help beginners to advanced/expert level + how to efficiently manage computational projects
-   Martin Jones - command line skills (pip install for e.g.)
-   Rebecca Wilson - IP and open source skills, and training to retain talent
-   Aida Mehonic - I think training people up on Binder would do wonders for reproducible practice skills. Also training on GitHub would be really useful I think. 
-   Khanisa Riaz - Seeing how the visual tools can be used effectively, and how the results are communicated publicly to engage citizens
-   Lydia France - Level of fear that people have to learn computational skills, and there are very little materials are written in accessible manner (for introductory level)
-   Arielle Bennett (ATI) - GitHub as a project management tool specifically
-   Katrina Payne

## Notes from the meeting:

### The project:

-   Guiding document: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience) 
-   Placeholder name: Introduction to Data Science for Biomedical Scientists: Turing-Crick Partnership Project
-   Resources we have identified in Turing for this project:
-   Research Engineering Group (Fede): Working on many materials that are not very introductory. Have materials for humanities - that can be adopted for biology/biomedical
-   The Turing Way: [https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/) \- co-created resource with researchers within and beyond Turing.
-   Missing intermediate training: there are The Carpentries intro materials and many great materials for advanced learners. However, there are not many bridging materials.
-   This project allocated 0.5 position for 6 months taken by Lydia, and supervised by Malvika and Fede - this will be done in coordination with all the stakeholders present today
    
### Crick’s expectations, vision, and resources for this project: 

-   Resources:
  -   James B: Have courses in R and Python, introductory level and Bioinformatics
  -   James F: many materials are generic (not contextual), not tightly tied to Crick data or best practices. R, Python, command line level, nextflow, bioinformatics materials can be made contextual
  -   Martin: Image analysis
-   Identifying target audience: 
  -   minimalist needs for learners (PhD students): small modular needs, will be hard to deploy in the given time 
  -   Group leaders will have needs at strategic level ← James F. and Amy Strange agree on teaching ML or supervising a postdoc who want to apply advance techniques
  -   Martin: introductory materials exist in some form, but maybe group leader as target might be a useful investment
  -   James B: You won’t get prolonged engagement from group leaders, we can put some masterclass on managing computational project
    -   Managing data, version control, organising project
  -   James F: These masterclass could be helpful at mobilising a wider network of people who can help sharing feedback and help develop (curate) resources for their groups
  -   We can phrase this as a strategic need (rather than 'good to have' for research)
  -   KW: can build materials with resources for different roles, and then can have overview seminars (masterclass) that could be advertisement for other resources that exist (that we can curate)
-   We will not be delivering the event, but the materials
-   Risk mitigating space for the group leaders
    -   BDM: Parallel thread for connecting what they already know from experiment/biological science.
-   Contact people from Crick:
  -   James Fleming:
    -   Need to bring in Crick training and bioinformatics  
    -   Many people will help in developing this materials
  -   James Briscoe
    -   There are cross-cutting theme that can be used to involve more people
    -   E.g. Single cell, image segmentation/analysis
  -   Rebecca Wilson
    -   Some fellow who are working with Turing
-   Data at Crick that could be reused:
    -   This can be from a paper published by someone in Crick that has done an excellent job at demo-ing how Crick would like to promote a computational project.
    -   Rebecca: will consult with colleagues to curate good examples
    -   James F: To the point around computational resources, it's a perfect way to tie in the course material to using our main storage facility, and GPC/HPC infrastructure as appropriate 
    -   General thoughts about image analysis (MJ)
      -   We have a couple of image analysis courses using common open-source software (mostly Fiji/ImageJ) and the course-leader Dave Barry got a promotion recently and is aiming to ramp up and coordinate image analysis training
      -   The Royal Microscopical Society has started a new “Data Analysis in Imaging” science section which I’m chairing. We are planning to focus on training, so would be great to coordinate
      -   Re: the scale in bioimaging: very hard to define, could be 10-100MB for simple confocal etc up to TB for volume EM/cryo-EM
      -   There is an increasing drive for publicly available realistic datasets e.g. [https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/](https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/) and the example datasets e.g. in [https://github.com/HenriquesLab/ZeroCostDL4Mic/wiki](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/ZeroCostDL4Mic/wiki) 
      -   If we want community input, by far the best place to procure it would be the integrated forum at [forum.image.sc ](http://forum.image.sc)

## Action points and contact person:

-   James Fleming to help collect Crick resources here: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/issues/14](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-training-for-bioscience/issues/14) 
-   Rebecca: Help coordinate the discussion and curation of some examples.
-   Malvika: To summarise notes and send a follow up email

## Who else should be invited? (please feel free to add name and contact so we can involve them in the project)

-   Turing data stories folks might find the masterclass format interesting and may have interest in creating/hosting demo
-   Dave Barry (image analysis trainer @TheCrick)
